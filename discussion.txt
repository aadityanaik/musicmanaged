STARTLOG 
ALPHA: Let's use this one for discussing the project
ALPHA: Enter new message after a line
ALPHA: Use your own nickname
ALPHA: Out.

UKP: Ok
UKP: I've set up the server 

ALPHA: Logged On
ALPHA: Which user should I log in with?

UKP: Create your own if you wish.

ALPHA: Okay, out.

UKP: Easy for independent testing on each others machines
UKP: Lets remove the Material Design Sidebar and make our own?
    

ALPHA: Copy. Roger.
ALPHA: Which file do we move onto? Let's do it together

UKP: I say lets do upload.ejs. Also, I've removed the sidebar we took from material

ALPHA: Roger.
ALPHA: On upload.ejs
ALPHA: In upload.ejs, we need a proper material design, footer css and other css in general.

UKP: Let's build out the bootstrap and basic grid system first, then we will see if material is the way to go.

ALPHA: Sorry for the interference, wasn't looking at the monitor. Also, yeah. Let's do that. Going back to upload.ejs

UKP: Sorry, I was looking at Home.EJS all this while. Many apologies.

ALPHA: THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING...

UKP: Fixed styles for upload.ejs by creating upload.css

ALPHA: Yup, also there is horizontal ruler bcoz of the TABLE, below "BROWSER a file....", we must get rid of it, or structure the table such that the file choose bar comes below it. out.
ALPHA: Took care of the heading for ADD FILES TO YOUR LIBRARY. OUT.

UKP: Noted. Saw that. Good work.
UKP: Updating the site-wide CSS later. Going to deprecate h1-caption and such classes.

ALPHA: Works

UKP:

ALPHA: ATTACHING THE METADAT BIT BELOW

*************DON'T DELETE*************

Usage
var ffmetadata = require("ffmetadata");
 
// Read song.mp3 metadata
ffmetadata.read("song.mp3", function(err, data) {
    if (err) console.error("Error reading metadata", err);
    else console.log(data);
});
 
// Set the artist for song.mp3
var data = {
  artist: "Me",
};
ffmetadata.write("song.mp3", data, function(err) {
    if (err) console.error("Error writing metadata", err);
    else console.log("Data written");
});
 
Artwork
You can optionally include an array of files to be added to the source file. This is a destructive action, it will overwrite any previous streams on the file. For audio data, this is typically just one image. For video, this is where you would write additional audio streams or subtitle tracks.

var options = {
  attachments: ["cover.jpg"],
};
ffmetadata.write("song.mp3", {}, options, function(err) {
    if (err) console.error("Error writing cover art");
    else console.log("Cover art added");
});
Metadata
Metadata might include the following fields:

"artist": artist name
"album": album name
"title": song title
"track": place in the album (e.g. "5/8")
"disc": for multidisc albums
"label": record label
"date": arbitrary, but usually year (e.g. "2002")
See FFmpeg Metadata for details

**************FIN**************

UKP: Mate, shall I push this? I'll take a quick break and go eat something. Haven't had lunch.

ALPHA: Same, meanwhile, check upload.js, in scripts. added a dyanmic upper date validation, although it's not working I believe. Should work, right?
UKP: Yes, I think so.
