Some intro

Basically, to go to normal website, do

```
$ node server.js
```

If you want to go to website, go to http://localhost:5000

If you want to use the API, go to http://localhost:5000/<endpoint>

Endpoints-

/listuser - get list of all users in mysql database

/adduser/username/password - add username, password to database

for the database, make sure mysql is installed

In mysql, add user called musicmanaged with password amusicalpassword, and add a database called musicmanaged for that user

If no work, I'll check next time we meet
